For large radio systems, regex may be better instead of specifying a long list of radio IDs. In case a Unit ID will be matched by regex but you do not want to use the associated unit name, you can put the specific unit ID and unit name before the regex, so it will be chosen before reaching the regex."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"In the second row of the example below, the first capture group ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"([0-9]{2})")," becomes ",(0,r.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"$1")," for the unit name, so an ID like 1210207 gets translated to Engine 20. In the third row, only the start of the string is being matched, so an ID of 173102555 is translated into Ambulance 102."),(0,r.kt)("table",null,(0,r.kt)("thead",{parentName:"table"},(0,r.kt)("tr",{parentName:"thead"},(0,r.kt)("th",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Unit ID"),(0,r.kt)("th",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Unit Name"))),(0,r.kt)("tbody",{parentName:"table"},(0,r.kt)("tr",{parentName:"tbody"},(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"911000"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Dispatch")),(0,r.kt)("tr",{parentName:"tbody"},(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"1","[1245]","10(","[0-9]","{2})","[127]"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Engine $1")),(0,r.kt)("tr",{parentName:"tbody"},(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"/^1","[78]","3(1","[0-9]","{2})/"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Ambulance $1")))))}u.isMDXComponent=!0},5200:(t,e,a)=>{a.d(e,{Z:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/gqrx-0d028e31f0cebea2fe399cb4879c6812.png"}}]);
