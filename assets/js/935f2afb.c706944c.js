Images are published frequently to  Docker Hub. The images have GNURadio 3.8 and all other required dependencies built into it, so it should be ready to go and be a much faster solution than compiling. Images have been built for amd64 (amd64 is used by all modern Intel and AMD CPUs) and most popular flavors of ARM.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Install/INSTALL-LINUX":{"id":"Install/INSTALL-LINUX","title":"Linux Installs","description":"This page covers installing Trunk Recorder on a Linux box.

If you are interested in doing this, you should really get a Pi 4. It maybe possible to get things running on an older Pi, but you often get unexpect behavior and errors. A Pi 4 can handle 3-4 simulatanious recordings. Make sure you have a good power supply. Also pay attention to heat. If the Pi gets too hot, it will slow down. A good case or fan can help keep it going full tilt. You can also just run debian on a NUC or Miniform PC. These commands will work with a vaneilla debian install as well.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"intro","description":"Sponsors","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"notes/CALL-HANDLING":{"id":"notes/CALL-HANDLING","title":"CALL-HANDLING","description":"Use Mermaid Live to edit the charts.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"notes/PLUGIN-SYSTEM":{"id":"notes/PLUGIN-SYSTEM","title":"Plugin System","description":"The plugin system is designed to allow third parties to integrate their own features without changing the core code of trunk-recorder, and allow for features to be updated independently of the trunk-recorder code base.
